# Agrica.net demo project

# About

üçé "Agrica.net" was a project completed to show a panel of judges a semi-functioning protype of a service that would create a local network of food distribution focusing on providers of local & sustainable foods, including farmers and CSA programs.

üçê The project was completed during the 48-hour "Start Norfolk" event, by a team of developers and designers.

## "Start Norfolk" 2011:

Start Norfolk was a 48-hour tech event which focused on building a web or mobile application which could form the basis of a credible business over the course of a weekend. 

The weekend brought together people with different skill sets - primarily software developers, graphic designers and business people - to build applications and develop a commercial case around them.

It was held November 11-13, 2011 at Innovation Research Park at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, USA.
